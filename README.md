# Hmm ...?
This is readme file. It describes a project giving opportunity to publish through github.io.

This github.io repository doesn't have a content page which would be called index.\[something\]. Therefore if you hit link below...

http://marcinnowakowski.github.io

... you get 404 error.

However if you will try to navigate to those other two links you might find something interesting... or not? Have fun...
